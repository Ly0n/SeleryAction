# Configuration file for LibreSelery 
## simulation lets you run LibreSelery without payout or coinbase tokens
simulation: False


## include the contributors from target repository
include_main_repository: True

## include the dependencies of the target folder. This requires a libraries.io token.
include_dependencies: False

## include the tooling and runtime from file tooling_repos.yml
## You can add tools, which will not be detected by the dependency scanner.
## For example command line tools. If you want to support the LibreSelery project, include it in tooling_repos.yml
include_tooling_and_runtime: False

## minimum number of commits to be considered as contributor
min_contributions_required_payout: 1

## number of randomly selected dependency contributors
included_dependency_contributor: 0


# weight configuations
## base weight for all included contributors
uniform_weight: 30

## give weight to the last x git commits
## activity since specified git reference (tag, branch, commit hash, ...)
activity_since_commit: 'tag_regex:v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' # until last tag matching the regex
# activity_since_commit: "commit:HEAD~1" # last commit
# activity_since_commit: "commit:<sha>" # specific commit
# activity_since_commit: "commit:<branch>" # certain branch
# activity_since_commit: none # whole history

## weight for contributors in the activity time range defined by `activity_since_commit`
activity_weight: 30

# Strategy how every payout is split among contributors.
## The weights are used to decide which contributors receive how much money.
## "full_split": All contributors receive a payout according to their weight.
## "random_split": X contributors are randomly picked using the weight as probabilty.
split_strategy: "full_split"

## the amount of payout per run that is used for all split strategies
payout_per_run: 0.000020
## the minimum payout per contributor. Below that number the payout is skipped to avoid bother contributors with very small payout. 
min_payout_per_contributor: 0.00005

# Random Split Strategy configuration
## Please consider that:
## random_split_picked_contributors X random_split_btc_per_picked_contributors = payout_per_run
## LibreSelery does fail if this does not apply.

## numbers of total contributors payout per run at random split
random_split_picked_contributors: 3

## the amount of btc send per user at random_split
random_split_btc_per_picked_contributor: 0.000000


# payout configuration
## bitcoin address used to pay contributors and receive donations
bitcoin_address: "3PVdiyLPR7MgaeFRJLW9mfuESZS2aAPX9w"

## automatically check that the configured `bitcoin_address` matches the coinbase wallet address
perform_wallet_validation: True

## Send payout notification emails by coinbase to contributors?
send_email_notification: False

## message included in every coinbase email. (after the automatically generated thank you message.)
optional_email_message: "You are part of a new experimental funding concept for free and open projects. Enjoy your fresh Selery."
